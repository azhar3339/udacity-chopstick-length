# Optimal Chopstick Length

This is technically "project 0" of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree course, but I decided to go back and spend time completing it anyway even though they added it after I had already completed the first project.

It showed me how IPython Notebooks worked, was a quick/simple little demo of how to use them.

## How to see

Open the HTML file, which is an export from the .ipynb file.

## How to run

You'll need Python 2.7 installed on your system.

Download the .ipynb file, and run `ipython notebook Data_Analyst_ND_Project0.ipynb`. 

This will open up a web browser and you can see the notebook and edit it yourself.
